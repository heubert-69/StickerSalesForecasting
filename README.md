Sticker Sales Forecasting
This project focuses on forecasting sticker sales across different countries, stores, and product types using historical sales data. It was developed as part of a Kaggle competition and employs time series machine learning techniques to predict future sales.

Project Overview
The goal is to accurately predict sticker sales by leveraging various time-based, economic, and categorical features. The model built here is a Ridge Regression pipeline optimized via hyperparameter tuning.

Features
Time-based features:

Lag variables capturing past sales data

Rolling averages and expanding means to smooth trends

Sales momentum indicators

Holiday detection:

Utilizes the holidays Python library to mark special dates by country, accounting for holiday effects on sales

Economic context:

Incorporates economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, unemployment, and interest rates sourced from the World Bank to provide macroeconomic insights

Cyclical encoding:

Applies sine and cosine transformations to encode cyclical patterns in months and weekdays, helping the model understand periodicity

Categorical encoding:

Uses label encoding and creates combination features (e.g., country_product) to capture interaction effects

Model
Algorithm: Ridge Regression

Preprocessing: Implemented through a scikit-learn pipeline, ensuring clean and reproducible feature transformations

Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning performed with GridSearchCV to find the best model parameters

Output
The model generates sales predictions formatted according to Kaggleâ€™s required submission.csv for evaluation.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, holidays, matplotlib (optional for visualization)

You can install the required packages with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn holidays matplotlib
```

Running the Project
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/heubert-69/StickerSalesForecasting.git
cd StickerSalesForecasting
```

2. Prepare your dataset following the Kaggle competition instructions.

3. Run the main script (replace with your actual script name):
